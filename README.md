### Hey there :)


I'm Just5MoreMinutes!<br>
I'm a developer, student, writer, music-enthusiast and also a huge lover of coffee.<br>
I started coding around 5 years ago at the age of 12 (though, to be fair, back then I wasn't too dedicated) and since then developed a love-hate relationship with it.
